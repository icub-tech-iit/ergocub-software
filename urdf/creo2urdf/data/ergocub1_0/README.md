> The urdf of `ergoCubGazeboV1/SN000` has never been generated with [`creo2urdf`](https://github.com/icub-tech-iit/creo2urdf), it has been created in the transition period when for using [`simmechanics_to_urdf`](https://github.com/robotology/simmechanics_to_urdf) was needed to port the CAD [from CREO9 to CREO7](https://github.com/robotology/simmechanics-to-urdf/issues/55) thus we minimized the fixes on the CAD, patching it via software(https://github.com/icub-tech-iit/ergocub-software/issues/106)
> 
> The simulation model CAD has not been updated for a while, we are keeping the yaml up-to-date but if changes are needed in the robot model it is better to apply them directly to the urdf instead of generating with `creo2urdf`.

This is the mapping between the CAD files, the files contained in this folder and the files contained in `ergocub-software/urdf/ergoCub/robots`:
